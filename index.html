    <h2>WEB</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) is an information network built on top of the Internet. Its graph structure is given by the hyperlink connections among web pages. Many important services run over the WWW, like the open access encyclopaedia produced by the users, Wikipedia, and widespread social networks, such as Twitter. In order to uncover the hierarchical structure of these services, in this chapter some global centrality measures are introduced: the HITS algorithm and Google Pagerank. For the case of Twitter this will result in the identification of so-called influencers. As an important application of networks, community detection procedures are introduced to reveal the cluster structure of the networks. In the case of the Sardinian Wikipedia, these communities are the relevant semantic concepts related to its language.</p>
